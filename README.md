# The Long Way:

![SelectPlayer](client/public/select-players.png)

It’s been five years since the cataclysm. You’ve been etching out a living in what remains of Sacramento, CA. The landscape of skyscrapers and towering structures has been reduced to smoldering piles of rubble from the near daily earthquakes. The time to journey east is now.
	You’ve been modifying an old Ford truck to make the journey, welding on armor and siphoning what gas you can. Before the signal died out last year, you picked up a radio signal repeating the message: “Washington D.C., is the last remaining safe zone. For anyone listening, if you can make it here, we can help you.”
	You could hit the road now or make one last stop at Old Pete’s to buy additional supplies. What will it be?
1.	Leave
2.	You decided to visit Old Pete’s one last time to see what he has that might be useful for the long journey east.
